# Computer Vision Project – Sign language interprator

## INTRODUCTION

Not everyone understands sign language,this project aims to solve this by removing the need of having a person who understands sign language interpret every single sign.

The project employs the follwing key areas:
1. Computer vision.
2. Deep learning. [TensorFlow library]

# The project will be implemented in 2 phases:
1. Recognize simple hand poses by tracing the hand’s joints.
2. Implement TensorFlow object detection.
3. Implement Deep learning & train model.

## Phase 1: Implement hand pose detection
- Recognize the flow of movement of  both hands finding key areas on a hand. Key-points correspond to the joints.

Dependencies & Tools used

-- MediaPipe - Media Pipe is a library that enables object tracking.

-- OpenCV Python bindings.
