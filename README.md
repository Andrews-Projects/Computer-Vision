# Computer Vision Project – Sign language interpreter

## INTRODUCTION

Not everyone understands sign language,this project aims to solve this by removing the need of having a person who understands sign language interpret every single sign.

The project employs the follwing key areas:
1. Computer vision.
2. Deep learning. [TensorFlow library]

# The project will be implemented in 3 phases:
1. Recognize simple hand poses by tracing the hand’s joints.
2. Implement TensorFlow object detection.
3. Implement Deep learning & train model.

## Phase 1: Implement hand pose detection
1. Recognize the flow of movement of both hands finding key areas on a hand. Key-points correspond to the joints.

Dependencies & Tools used

** MediaPipe - Media Pipe is an open source library that enables object tracking by offering customizable M.L solutions for live and streaming media.

** OpenCV Python bindings - OpenCV is an open source framework used for Image and video manipulations i.e Computer vision.

## Phase 2: Implementing TensorFlow object detection

## Phase 3: Implementing Deep learning & train model
