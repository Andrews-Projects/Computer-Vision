Part 1 - descritption
- What is the problem or customer need you are addressing and why is it important to solve it?(show theres a prolem worth solving,app benefit,customer benefit, and the need for dev new appllication)

- Briefly describe the solution and how it works

Sign language detection using deep learning (Tensorflow library)

- What about your solution is innovative

It uses major top technologies such as:
Computer Vision.
Deep learning.

Part 2 scalability and impact

- What are your primary customer segments & how big can the addressable market become(show that early adopters are willing to buy the product & a big room for customer growth)
1. Sign language educators.
2. Sign language leaners.

the targeted market size may vary due to the varying n.o of disabled in various areas

- existing & possible future alternatives & why should customers select yours as better
1.A smart glove that converts sign language movements into audio speech--> link[https://www.pulselive.co.ke/bi/tech/25-year-old-kenyan-invents-gloves-that-convert-sign-language-into-audio-speech/rfc9cyj]

My solution is purely software,machine independent and doesnt require external peripherals such as webcams  unless available.

- In what ways are you growing your n.o of custoemrs & users OR how do plan to grow your numbers of customers & users 

Offer free trials or a periodic testing phase(show a road map & milestones to achieve...

- Next steps or targets to achieve in the next 3-12 months

Extensive training of the deep learning models

- Obstacles to be identified or may be encountered in the future & what steps you will take to overcome them

Obtaining more sign language images for effective model training.
